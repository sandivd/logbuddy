## ü§ñ Development Approach: Vibe Coding

This project was developed using a method known as **Vibe Coding**. Instead of manually writing every line of React and Tailwind CSS, the development process involved giving high-level instructions and refinement prompts to an AI assistant, which then generated the code.

> Vibe coding is a modern approach to software development where you use natural language‚Äîeither spoken or typed‚Äîto describe what you want a program to do, and then an AI (usually a large language model, or LLM) generates the actual code for you. Instead of manually writing every line of code, you give the AI high-level instructions or prompts, and it handles the technical implementation.

This approach allowed for rapid prototyping and iteration, focusing on the overall structure and functionality of the application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **TypeScript:** Adds static typing to JavaScript to improve code quality and developer experience.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
-   **Lucide React:** A beautiful and consistent icon library.
-   **Create React App:** Used as the initial project boilerplate.
-   **Craco:** Used to override the default Create React App configuration to enable Tailwind CSS.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm) installed on your computer.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    This single command will install React, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React, Craco, and all other necessary packages defined in `package.json`.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload when you make changes.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
